1.	How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)
It took me roughly 9 hours to complete this assessment, although I'm not as sure about the time as I usually am when filling this out.
2.	What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)
I used the recorded lectures, but also used teaching websites to help me make my code.
3.	Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)
I did not.
4.	Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?
I did not ask any questions.
5.	Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.
This was a relatively easier assignment. I feel confident that I can do one like this again.
